# Trica_Assignment
Consider the data provided in airline-data.js file. Here we have airlines variable that holds the mapping of an airline with its corresponding name. flights_jan_01_2008 is an object that contains the mapping of airlines that had flights at a particular time on 1st Jan 2008.

Consuming these data mentioned above and using plain Javascript, HTML and CSS, construct a table view (refer to the attached image file for design reference) in which there will be 24 columns representing the 24 hours of a day and each row in the table will show the airline name and the number of flights it had at each particular hour of the day.
If there are no flights of an airline for a particular time of day,  show - in that cell of the table.
On hover over a cell, the cell of the table should highlight (e.g. green colour as in the image shown)
